# MetaFunctions Recap
______


* Created by decorating functions with `@node`.

* Work by combining functions into a new function-like object.

* Are not called as part of composition.

* Decorated functions can still be used as regular functions (no implicit partialling).

* Pass arguments based on position, not key word.

* Allow branching with `star`, merging with `&`.

* Can do anything pipenode can do (I think).
